# CrossDeviceConnections
Drawbridge Cross-Device Connections.  As consumers move across devices to complete online tasks, their identity becomes fragmented. Marketers, hoping to target them with meaningful messages, recommendations, and customized experiences, aren't always able to discern when activity on different devices is tied to one user vs. many users.  Given usage data and a set of fabricated non-personally-identifiable IDs, this competition tasks you with making individual user connections across a variety of digital devices. Improving marketers' ability to identify individual users as they switch between devices means you'll see relevant messages wherever you go, making it easy for you to plan the best, most fjord-filled trip ever.
